# HEART-DISEASE
A CASE STUDY ON HEART DISEASE
A case study project to analyze heart disease, investigate patients with heart diseases an no heart disease, and build machine learning models to predict the true positives while reducing false negatives using 8 different Machine learning Algorithms. I cleaned that dataset, transformed it, and performed an Exploratory data analysis to discover actionable insights, patterns, and trends. The data  was pre-processed by carrying out feature engineering, and normalization techniques Using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGB Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor, SGD Classifier, SVC,	Naive Bayes, and Decision tree
Comparing all the models, the Random Forest classifier (Confusion Matrix) predicted more correctly.
